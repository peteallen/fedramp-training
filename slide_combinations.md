# Slide Combinations in Module 1

To reduce the number of short slides in Module 1, the following combinations were made:

1. Combined "Policy Documentation & Access", "Primary Contacts & Responsibilities", and "Training Management" into a single section titled "Policy Administration and Responsibilities".

2. Combined "Policy Review Schedule", "Procedure Updates", and "Change Communication" into "Policy Maintenance and Updates".

3. Combined "Ask Questions!" and "Why This Matters" into "Final Thoughts".

This reduces the total content sections from 11 to 6.

The changes have been applied to `src/data/modules/1.json`.
