### 3. Custom Syntax Highlighting System

**Built-in Theme Support:**
Instead of relying on external CSS files, implemented a custom syntax highlighting system integrated with the app's design system:

```css
/* Base code block styling */
.hljs {
  background: theme(colors.gray.50) !important;
  color: theme(colors.gray.900) !important;
  border-radius: theme(borderRadius.lg);
  padding: theme(spacing.4);
  font-family: 'SF Mono', 'Monaco', 'Inconsolata', 'Roboto Mono', 'Source Code Pro', monospace;
  line-height: 1.6;
  border: 1px solid theme(colors.gray.200);
}

/* Dark mode support */
.dark .hljs {
  background: theme(colors.gray.950) !important;
  color: theme(colors.gray.100) !important;
  border-color: theme(colors.gray.700);
}
```

**Syntax Highlighting Colors:**
