Here's what we do to satisfy AT-2:\n\nUnlike some companies that do \"one-and-done\" training, we believe security awareness is an ongoing journey. Think of it as the yearly sequel that's actually useful, not the never-ending movie franchise kind! üé¨"

Every new team member completes security and privacy awareness training as part of onboarding ‚Äì essentially Day 1 (or at least within the first week, once the email and coffee mug are set up).\n\n## What New Hires Learn\n\nWe cover the fundamentals:\n‚Ä¢ Our password rules and password manager usage\n‚Ä¢ How to handle data securely\n‚Ä¢ Spotting phishing emails\n‚Ä¢ Using our AWS and Google Drive securely\n‚Ä¢ Basic security expectations before system access\n\nIf you're new and reading this, welcome aboard! üéâ Expect **Pete** (or **Dave** if Pete's running late) to walk you through the dos and don'ts ASAP, before you get those AWS keys that **Savvy** guards like a samurai protects their sword."

FedRAMP and our policy require this annual cadence to make sure knowledge stays fresh and habits stay sharp.\n\n## How We Make It Work\n\nOnce every 12 months we'll gather (either in-person or via a video call/screen-share ‚Äì hopefully everyone can make it, even if **Braden** has to join from whatever state he's actually from this week) for an annual refresher.\n\nWe know your time is valuable, so we keep this concise and relevant ‚Äì hitting the important updates and reminders. So even if you've been here 5 years and can recite our security policy in your sleep, you still need the yearly training ‚Äì threats evolve, and so do our defenses."

      "content": "## Training After Changes or Incidents\n\nWe provide training when needed, not just on a schedule. If there's a significant change ‚Äì say **Braden** deploys a slick new UI feature, **Savvy** adopts a new DevOps technology, or we update a policy ‚Äì and it impacts security or privacy, we'll update our training materials and inform everyone.\n\n## Learning from Incidents\n\nIf a security incident or \"near-miss\" happens, we treat it as a learning opportunity. For example, if someone falls for a phishing test (don't worry, we won't name and shame üòâ), or if **Savvy** finds one of **Pete's** bugs in our app, **Pete** will incorporate the lessons learned into our training content promptly.\n\n## Staying Current\n\nOur goal is to make sure we learn from mistakes ‚Äì whether ours or others in the industry ‚Äì so we don't repeat them. That might mean sending out a \"Security Alert\" email or adding a new module to the next training session."

      "content": "## Beyond Formal Training\n\nOne class a year isn't enough to cover 365 days of risks! We run an ongoing awareness program to keep security and privacy in mind throughout the year. We use a variety of techniques:\n\n## Communication Methods\n\n**Email/Slack Reminders:** Occasionally, you'll see security tips or reminders pop up in our team Slack or inbox. **Pete** might share a quick \"Security Tip of the Month\" or an article about a new scam targeting small businesses. We promise to keep these infrequent and to-the-point (bonus points if they include a funny meme).\n\n**Team Meetings:** We'll take a few minutes in team meetings now and then for a security topic. For instance, a quick demo on how to use our password manager, or a reminder to update your laptop's software. Maybe **Krista** will share some wisdom from her nursing days about double-checking critical information, or **Savvy** might show us a cool security feature they discovered."

If you click the fake bad link ‚Äì no real harm done ‚Äì you'll get a friendly \"gotcha!\" and a reminder of what clues you missed. It's okay to fail in a simulation as long as we learn from it.\n\n**Visible Prompts:** We have a short login banner on our systems that reminds you of your responsibility (ever noticed that little blurb when logging into the AWS console or our app admin panel?). Around the office (or virtual office), we might also share quick-reference guides on our Google Drive.\n\n## Culture of Security\n\nMost importantly, we encourage a culture where security is part of everyday thinking. You won't get in trouble for bringing up a potential security concern ‚Äì in fact, it's encouraged! Hear about a new vulnerability on the news? Share it. Not sure if a weird email is legit? Ask! We'd rather have false alarms than missed real threats."

      "title": "Keeping Content Fresh",
      "content": "## Content Updates & Improvement\n\nWe keep our training content fresh and engaging. The materials are reviewed and updated at least annually ‚Äì which lines up with the annual training cycle. Each year, **Pete** (with input from any volunteers ‚Äì maybe **Shelly** will add some Vermont wisdom) will spruce up the slides/notes to remove stale information and add current topics.\n\n## Unified Training Approach\n\nFedRAMP guidance notes that we don't necessarily need separate \"basic\" and \"advanced\" courses as long as we cover all necessary topics. Given our small size, we roll everything into one comprehensive program that's appropriate for all.\n\nWe'll cover both security awareness (general knowledge for everyone) and security literacy (a bit more in-depth understanding of threats and best practices) together. After all, a well-informed team is harder for bad guys to trick.\n\n## Reality Check\n\nYes, that's a lot of talk about training, but the bottom line is we want to keep ClearTriage secure and compliant without boring you to tears. Ask questions, share your funny security fail stories, and take the content seriously. Staying secure is an ongoing process, not just a once-a-year event. Keep that cautious mindset year-round ‚Äì it's like keeping an eye out for the \"wet floor\" sign to avoid slips, except in cyberspace. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

      "title": "Introduction to Insider Threats",
      "content": "## AT-2(2): Insider Threat Awareness\n\nNow it's time for a special topic: Insider Threat Awareness. (Cue the dramatic music! üéª) Don't worry, this isn't about making you paranoid or turning our friendly little team into a spy movie.\n\n## What Is an Insider Threat?\n\nAn \"insider threat\" is when someone with authorized access to our systems or data misuses that access ‚Äì either wittingly or unwittingly (on purpose or by accident) ‚Äì to harm the organization. In plain English:\n‚Ä¢ A disgruntled employee doing something malicious\n‚Ä¢ A well-meaning teammate who inadvertently causes a security breach\n‚Ä¢ Anyone: a full-time employee, contractor, or ex-employee with lingering access\n\n## Why We Care\n\nEven though we trust each other on this team (after all, we've shared enough medical histories to know that half the team is missing their appendix!), mistakes happen, and very rarely, people's intentions can change. We're a small company, which actually helps ‚Äì it's hard to be a sneaky bad guy when you sit next to (or Zoom with) everyone every day."

      "title": "Recognizing Insider Threat Indicators",
      "content": "## Everyone's a Sensor\n\nWe are all the first line of defense against insider threats. That means if you see signs that \"something's not right,\" it's up to you to speak up. Trust your instincts ‚Äì if a teammate's behavior or actions make you uneasy from a security perspective, don't ignore it.\n\nThis doesn't mean we start suspecting each other for no reason; it just means we stay observant. (Think of it like neighborhood watch: we keep an eye out, but we're not putting on tinfoil hats.)\n\n## Data Access Red Flags\n\n**Downloading or Accessing Unusually Large Amounts of Data:** If you notice someone suddenly exporting our entire database, code repository, or customer list to a personal device without a clear need, that's suspicious. In a company of our size, roles are well-known, so if **Krista** starts poking around AWS infrastructure files, or if **Braden** starts cloning all the sales documents, it's okay to raise an eyebrow (and a question).\n\n**Bypassing Security Controls:** If someone tries to disable antivirus on their laptop, or frequently complains about and attempts to circumvent access controls (\"Ugh, I turned off multi-factor auth because it's annoying\"), that's a warning sign."

      "title": "Behavioral and Access Pattern Warnings",
      "content": "## Unusual Access Patterns\n\n**Odd Hours or Locations:** We all might pull the occasional late night (especially **Savvy** with a baby on the way!), but if you see a colleague who typically works 9‚Äì5 suddenly accessing systems at 2 AM regularly, or logging in from unusual locations, it might merit a check-in.\n\n## Behavioral Changes\n\n**Disgruntled or Drastic Changes:** Keep an eye on morale. If someone becomes very disgruntled or if a normally social teammate suddenly becomes very withdrawn and secretive, we should show concern. Sometimes personal issues can escalate to problematic actions. Often, simply reaching out as a friend can help.\n\n**Social Engineering Within:** An insider threat isn't always stealing data ‚Äì it could be manipulating others internally. No one should be sharing credentials or asking for others' login information \"because Pete said I need it.\"\n\n## Accidents and Negligence\n\n**Carelessness Risks:** Not all insider issues are malicious. Example: someone leaving a laptop unattended in a public place (like at one of **Dave's** hiking spots), or accidentally emailing a sensitive document to the wrong address. Part of insider threat awareness is recognizing risky situations and taking action."

      "title": "Reporting and Response Procedures",
      "content": "## How to Report Concerns\n\nSo you've observed something concerning ‚Äì what now? **Report it to Pete Allen immediately.** **Pete** is our designated security point of contact for any insider threat concerns. You can email him (pete@cleartriage.com), message him on Slack, or if it's urgent, call him.\n\n**Remember: If you can't reach Pete, contact Dave as your backup!**\n\n## Why Report Quickly\n\nPrompt reporting is key; the sooner we investigate, the better we can prevent a possible incident. Don't worry about false alarms ‚Äì we'd rather investigate and find nothing than miss a real problem. Your report will be handled as confidentially as possible.\n\n## Management Response\n\nIf an insider threat is suspected or reported, **Pete** (with maybe **Dave** or **Shelly**) will discreetly investigate. This could involve:\n‚Ä¢ Checking system logs\n‚Ä¢ Having a one-on-one conversation with the person in question\n‚Ä¢ Involving external authorities if it's something very serious\n‚Ä¢ Quickly disabling accounts if needed to prevent further harm\n\nMost of the time, a potential insider issue can be resolved by addressing the person's grievances or correcting a mistake."

      "title": "Learning and Prevention",
      "content": "## Training & Support\n\nInsider threat awareness isn't about spying on your coworkers ‚Äì it's about looking out for each other and the company. Often, catching a concern early means we can help that person (if they're struggling or unaware of risk) or stop a bad decision in its tracks.\n\n**Rule of thumb:** When in doubt, just report it. **Pete** or **Dave** can help figure out if it's an issue or not.\n\n## Real-world Example\n\n*(Hypothetical scenario)* Imagine one of us, \"Alex,\" has been working long hours and seems very frustrated with a project. Alex starts saying things like \"This codebase is a disaster, maybe I should just post it online and let the world see!\" ‚Äì half-joking, but also visibly upset. üö© Red flag!\n\nWe talk to Alex, and at the same time give **Pete** a heads-up. Together, we find out Alex is burnt out and feels underappreciated. The solution might be some time off and a team discussion ‚Äì maybe even a team outing to watch a Chiefs game with **Krista's** husband! Crisis averted, trust preserved.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nStay alert, trust but verify, and remember that even on the inside, security is a team sport. Think of insider threat awareness like the game Among Us ‚Äì we're all crewmates working on tasks (our jobs), but we stay alert in case someone is acting \"sus.\" In real life, that emergency meeting button is **Pete's** phone number (or **Dave's** if Pete is late to answer). üõéÔ∏è"
