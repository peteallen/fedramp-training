      "content": "## AT-2: Security & Privacy Literacy Training and Awareness\n\nThis control is all about actually training our people (that's you!) in security and privacy basics, and keeping everyone aware throughout the year. Here's what we do to satisfy AT-2:\n\n\u2022 **New Hire Training:** When someone new joins ClearTriage, we don't throw them to the wolves. Every new team member completes security and privacy awareness training as part of onboarding \u2013 essentially Day 1 (or at least within the first week, once the email and coffee mug are set up). This ensures everyone starts off on the right foot, knowing our security expectations before they get access to sensitive systems. We cover the fundamentals: our password rules, how to handle data, spotting phishing emails, using our AWS and Google Drive securely, etc. If you're new and reading this, welcome aboard! \ud83c\udf89 Expect Pete (or Dave if Pete's running late) to walk you through the dos and don'ts ASAP, before you get those AWS keys that Savvy guards like a samurai protects their sword.\n\n\u2022 **Annual Refresher Training:** Security isn't \"one-and-done.\" All team members must retake security/privacy awareness training at least once each year. Once every 12 months we'll gather (either in-person or via a video call/screen-share \u2013 hopefully everyone can make it, even if Braden has to join from whatever state he's actually from this week) for an annual refresher. We know your time is valuable, so we keep this concise and relevant \u2013 hitting the important updates and reminders. (Think of it as the yearly sequel that's actually useful, not the never-ending movie franchise kind.) FedRAMP and our policy require this annual cadence to make sure knowledge stays fresh and habits stay sharp. So even if you've been here 5 years and can recite our security policy in your sleep, you still need the yearly training \u2013 threats evolve, and so do our defenses.\n\n\u2022 **Training After Changes or Incidents:** We also provide just-in-time training when needed. If there's a significant change \u2013 say Braden deploys a slick new UI feature, Savvy adopts a new DevOps technology, or we update a policy \u2013 and it impacts security or privacy, we'll update our training materials and inform everyone. Similarly, if a security incident or \"near-miss\" happens, we treat it as a learning opportunity. For example, if someone falls for a phishing test (don't worry, we won't name and shame \ud83d\ude09), or if Savvy finds one of Pete's bugs in our app, Pete will incorporate the lessons learned into our training content promptly. That might mean sending out a \"Security Alert\" email with what happened and how to avoid it, or adding a new module to the next training session. Our goal is to make sure we learn from mistakes \u2013 whether ours or others in the industry \u2013 so we don't repeat them.\n\n\u2022 **Awareness All Year Round:** Beyond formal training sessions, we run an ongoing awareness program to keep security and privacy in mind throughout the year. (Because let's face it, one class a year isn't enough to cover 365 days of risks.) We use a variety of techniques:\n  - **Email/Slack Reminders:** Occasionally, you'll see security tips or reminders pop up in our team Slack or inbox. Pete might share a quick \"Security Tip of the Month\" or an article about a new scam targeting small businesses. We promise to keep these infrequent and to-the-point (bonus points if they include a funny meme).\n  - **Team Meetings:** We'll take a few minutes in team meetings now and then for a security topic. For instance, a quick demo on how to use our password manager, or a reminder to update your laptop's software. We keep it interactive \u2013 you can ask questions or share experiences. Maybe Krista will share some wisdom from her nursing days about double-checking critical information, or Savvy might show us a cool security feature they discovered.\n  - **Interactive Exercises:** Once in a while, we may do something fun like a simulated phishing email to see if we're on our toes. If you click the fake bad link \u2013 no real harm done \u2013 you'll get a friendly \"gotcha!\" and a reminder of what clues you missed. It's okay to fail in a simulation as long as we learn from it.\n  - **Visible Prompts:** We have a short login banner on our systems that reminds you of your responsibility (ever noticed that little blurb when logging into the AWS console or our app admin panel?). It's the a re to keep security in the back of your mind. Around the office (or virtual office), we might also share quick-reference guides (one-pagers on data handling, for example) or even the occasional poster or infographic on our Google Drive for you to glance at.\n  - **Culture of Security:** Most importantly, we encourage a culture where security is part of everyday thinking. That means you won't get in trouble for bringing up a potential security concern \u2013 in fact, it's encouraged. Hear about a new vulnerability on the news? Share it. Not sure if a weird email is legit? Ask! We'd rather have false alarms than missed real threats.\n\n\u2022 **Content Updates & Improvement:** We keep our training content fresh and engaging. The materials are reviewed and updated at least annually \u2013 which lines up with the annual training cycle. Each year, Pete (with input from any volunteers \u2013 maybe Shelly will add some Vermont wisdom) will spruce up the slides/notes to remove stale information and add current topics. We also consider feedback: if last year everyone already knew the basics cold, we might go a bit more advanced or vice versa. And as mentioned, any new trends (e.g., a rise in phishing attempts, new compliance rules from our work with the VA) or incident learnings will be baked in promptly. By the time you see the training again, it won't be exactly the same each year \u2013 we try to avoid the \"ugh, this again\" syndrome.\n\n\u2022 **No Distinction Between Basic/Advanced \u2013 Unified Training:** FedRAMP guidance notes that we don't necessarily need separate \"basic\" and \"advanced\" courses as long as we cover all necessary topics. Given our small size, we roll everything into one comprehensive program that's appropriate for all. We'll cover both security awareness (general knowledge for everyone) and security literacy (a bit more in-depth understanding of threats and best practices) together. If something is too technical or not relevant to some roles, we'll explain it in simple terms or mark it optional, but we prefer to empower everyone with knowledge. After all, a well-informed team is harder for bad guys to trick.\n\n*(Quick reality check:)* Yes, that's a lot of talk about training, but the bottom line is we want to keep ClearTriage secure and compliant without boring you to tears. So we aim to make training sessions engaging and concise. Ask questions, share your funny security fail stories (like that time Pete forgot his laptop at the coffee shop \u2013 oh wait, we're not supposed to mention that), and take the content seriously. And remember, staying secure is an ongoing process, not just a once-a-year event. Keep that cautious mindset year-round \u2013 it's like keeping an eye out for the \"wet floor\" sign to avoid slips, except in cyberspace. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"

      "content": "## AT-2(2): Insider Threat Awareness\n\nNow it's time for a special topic: Insider Threat Awareness. (Cue the dramatic music! \ud83c\udfbb) Don't worry, this isn't about making you paranoid or turning our friendly little team into a spy movie. It's about being aware that sometimes, threats can come from within. An \"insider threat\" is when someone with authorized access to our systems or data misuses that access \u2013 either wittingly or unwittingly (on purpose or by accident) \u2013 to harm the organization. In plain English, it could be a disgruntled employee doing something malicious, or a well-meaning teammate who inadvertently causes a security breach by being careless. Insider threats can be anyone: a full-time employee, a contractor, or even an ex-employee who still has access they shouldn't.\n\nWhy do we care? Because even though we trust each other on this team (after all, we've shared enough medical histories to know that half the team is missing their appendix!), mistakes happen, and very rarely, people's intentions can change. We're a small company, which actually helps \u2013 it's hard to be a sneaky bad guy when you sit next to (or Zoom with) everyone every day. But we still need to cover this for FedRAMP, and more importantly, so that if something seems off, we know how to recognize it and respond.\n\nHere's what you need to know about insider threats and how to stay vigilant:\n\n\u2022 **Everyone's a Sensor:** We are all the first line of defense against insider threats. That means if you see signs that \"something's not right,\" it's up to you to speak up. Trust your instincts \u2013 if a teammate's behavior or actions make you uneasy from a security perspective, don't ignore it. This doesn't mean we start suspecting each other for no reason; it just means we stay observant. (Think of it like neighborhood watch: we keep an eye out, but we're not putting on tinfoil hats or starting a security conspiracy theory blog.)\n\n\u2022 **Potential Indicators:** What might an insider threat look like? Here are a few red flags or scenarios to keep on your radar:\n  - **Downloading or Accessing Unusually Large Amounts of Data:** For example, if you notice someone suddenly exporting our entire database, code repository, or customer list to a personal device or external drive without a clear need, that's suspicious. In a company of our size, roles are well-known, so if Krista starts poking around AWS infrastructure files, or if Braden starts cloning all the sales documents, it's okay to raise an eyebrow (and a question).\n  - **Bypassing Security Controls:** If someone tries to disable antivirus on their laptop, or frequently complains about and attempts to circumvent access controls (\"Ugh, I turned off multi-factor auth because it's annoying\"), that's a warning sign. Policy violations, especially if deliberate and repeated, shouldn't be ignored.\n  - **Unusual Hours or Access Patterns:** We all might pull the occasional late night (especially Savvy with a baby on the way!), but if you see a colleague who typically works 9\u20135 suddenly accessing systems at 2 AM regularly, or logging in from unusual locations, it might merit a check-in. They could be working on a secret passion project \u2013 or something could be amiss.\n  - **Disgruntled or Drastic Behavior Changes:** Keep an eye on morale. If someone becomes very disgruntled (e.g., openly bad-mouthing the company's mission or threatening like \"this place will regret this\" after a conflict), or if a normally social teammate suddenly becomes very withdrawn and secretive, we should show concern. Sometimes personal issues or conflicts can escalate to someone acting against the company's interest. Often, simply reaching out as a friend can help \u2013 other times, it might foreshadow problematic actions.\n  - **Social Engineering Within:** An insider threat isn't always stealing data \u2013 it could be manipulating others internally. For instance, if Bob (just a hypothetical name \u2013 we don't have a Bob) starts asking Mary for her login info saying \"Pete said I need it\" or tries to get someone else's higher privileges, that's not okay. No one should be sharing credentials or rights unofficially.\n  - **Negligence and Accidents:** Not all insider issues are malicious. Carelessness can be just as risky. Example: someone leaving a laptop unattended in a public place (like at one of Dave's hiking spots), or accidentally emailing a sensitive document to the wrong address. These mistakes happen \u2013 we're all human \u2013 but part of insider threat awareness is recognizing risky situations and taking action (like reminding a teammate, \"Hey, you left your laptop unlocked,\" or reporting a lost device immediately so we can secure accounts).\n\n\u2022 **Reporting and Response:** So you've observed something concerning \u2013 what now? Report it to Pete Allen immediately. Pete is our designated security point of contact for any insider threat concerns (as well as other security issues). You can email him (pete@cleartriage.com), message him on Slack, or if it's urgent, call him. **Remember: If you can't reach Pete, contact Dave as your backup!** Don't wait or tell others first \u2013 officially let Pete or Dave know so they can handle it appropriately. Prompt reporting is key; the sooner we investigate, the better we can prevent a possible incident. And don't worry about false alarms \u2013 we'd rather investigate and find nothing than miss a real problem. Your report will be handled as confidentially as possible, and retaliation for reporting an honest concern is absolutely against our values (and would itself be an insider threat in a way!).\n\n\u2022 **What Pete/Management Will Do:** If an insider threat is suspected or reported, Pete (with maybe Dave or Shelly) will discreetly investigate. This could involve checking system logs, having a one-on-one conversation with the person in question, or involving external authorities if it's something very serious. We also have procedures in place (per our policy) for disabling accounts quickly if needed, to prevent further harm. In extreme cases, law enforcement might be contacted \u2013 but let's hope we never go there. Most of the time, a potential insider issue can be resolved by addressing the person's grievances or correcting a mistake.\n\n\u2022 **Training & Support:** As part of this training module, we include scenarios and discussions about insider threats. We want you to recognize the signs and feel confident in taking action. Remember, insider threat awareness isn't about spying on your coworkers \u2013 it's about looking out for each other and the company. Often, catching a concern early means we can help that person (if they're struggling or unaware of risk) or stop a bad decision in its tracks. If you're unsure whether to report something, a good rule is: when in doubt, just report it. Pete or Dave can help figure out if it's an issue or not.\n\n\u2022 **Real-world Example & Lesson:** (Hypothetical scenario) Imagine one of us, \"Alex,\" has been working long hours and seems very frustrated with a project. Alex starts saying things like \"This codebase is a disaster, maybe I should just post it online and let the world see!\" \u2013 half-joking, but also visibly upset. \ud83d\udea9 Red flag! We talk to Alex, and at the same time give Pete a heads-up. Together, we find out Alex is burnt out and feels underappreciated. The solution might be some time off and a team discussion \u2013 maybe even a team outing to watch a Chiefs game with Krista's husband! Crisis averted, trust preserved. The key is we noticed and we acted. Insider threat training helped us know what to look for, and it turned a possible threat into an opportunity to support a teammate.\n\nIn summary, insider threat awareness is about maintaining a vigilant, caring environment. We look out for odd behavior regarding security, and we have each other's backs by reporting concerns. As one official course put it: \"You are your organization's first line of defense against someone who could do harm.\" If you see something, say something. We'd rather have a dozen false alarms than miss the one real danger. And in the unlikely case one of us did intend harm, we want to catch it early for everyone's sake. Stay alert, trust but verify, and remember that even on the inside, security is a team sport.\n\n*(Fun analogy:)* Think of insider threat awareness like the game Among Us \u2013 we're all crewmates working on tasks (our jobs), but we stay alert in case someone is acting \"sus.\" We hope there's no impostor, but if there is, we report it and hit the emergency meeting button! \ud83d\udece\ufe0f In real life, that button is Pete's phone number (or Dave's if Pete is late to answer). Fortunately, our odds are much better than in the game \u2013 we hire good people and treat each other well, which is the best defense. Still, a little vigilance goes a long way."
