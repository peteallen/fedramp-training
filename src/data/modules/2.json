      "content": "**Who has what access:**\n- **Pete & Savvy:** Full AWS production access via YubiKey authentication\n- **Braden & Dave:** Development/staging environments only\n- **ScaleSec consultants:** Specified production access for ConMon and infrastructure setup\n\n**YubiKey best practices:**\n- Never leave your YubiKey plugged in when not actively using it\n- Store it securely—treat it like your car keys\n- Report lost/damaged keys to Pete immediately (we have spares)\n- Test your YubiKey monthly to ensure it's working\n\n**Production access rules:**\n- All production changes require a second person aware (even at 2 AM)\n- Document what you're doing in our shared ops channel\n- No production experiments—use staging\n- If you don't have production access, don't try to get it\n\n**Remember:** With great access comes great responsibility. Our system directly impacts VA nurse decisions."

      "content": "**Why security matters more for us:**\nUnlike typical SaaS, a compromise in our system doesn't just mean bad data—it could mean incorrect medical guidance. Every line of code you write could affect patient care.\n\n**Development security practices:**\n\n**Source code management:**\n- All code goes through PR review (yes, even \"quick fixes\")\n- No secrets in code—ever. Not even in comments\n- Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager\n- Branch protection on main/master branches\n\n**Dependency management:**\n- Review dependency updates before merging\n- Understand what each dependency does\n- Pin versions in production to prevent surprises\n- Regular security audits of our dependency tree\n\n**System integrity:**\n- Version control all clinical logic changes\n- Require primary VA clinical contact sign-off for clinical modifications\n- Implement integrity verification for critical components\n- Log all access and modifications\n\n**Testing requirements:**\n- Security test cases for authentication/authorization\n- Input validation for all user inputs\n- Test integrity checks\n- Verify error messages don't leak sensitive info"

Use roles for services.\n- **Critical services:** CloudTrail (audit logs), GuardDuty (threat detection), Systems Manager (secure parameters)\n- **Access:** VPN or Session Manager only—no direct SSH"

      "content": "**Types of incidents we care about:**\n\n**1. Security incidents:**\n- Unauthorized access attempts\n- Suspected account compromise\n- Malicious code or activity\n- Data exposure (even though we have no PHI)\n\n**2. Availability incidents:**\n- Service outages affecting nurses\n- Salesforce integration failures\n- AWS service disruptions\n- Performance degradation\n\n**3. Integrity incidents:**\n- Suspected tampering with clinical logic\n- Unauthorized configuration changes\n- Failed integrity checks\n\n**Incident response process:**\n\n**Immediate actions (first 15 minutes):**\n1. **Assess severity:** Is this affecting live nurse workflows?\n2. **Contain if needed:** Isolate affected resources\n3. **Notify the chain:**\n   - Pete (primary)\n   - Savvy (for infrastructure)\n   - Dave (for business impact)\n   - ScaleSec (for complex issues)\n4. **Start incident log:** Document everything\n\n**Investigation phase:**\n- Check CloudTrail logs for unusual activity\n- Review application logs\n- Verify system integrity\n- Determine scope of impact\n\n**Recovery phase:**\n- Fix the immediate issue\n- Verify systems are functional\n- Confirm nurses can access the system\n- Document lessons learned\n\n**FedRAMP reporting requirements:**\n- Significant incidents must be reported within 24 hours\n- Monthly incident reports to FedRAMP PMO\n- Coordinate with ScaleSec for proper reporting"

      "title": "5 | Contingency Planning & Disaster Recovery",
      "content": "**Our continuity strategy:**\nVA nurses depend on ClearTriage 24/7. Our contingency plan ensures we can restore service quickly if disaster strikes.\n\n**RTO/RPO targets:**\n- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** 4 hours\n- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** 1 hour\n- These aren't just numbers—they represent how long nurses might be without clinical decision support\n\n**Backup strategy:**\n- Automated daily backups of all databases\n- All application data backed up with cross-region replication\n- Configuration as code (Infrastructure as Code)\n- Backup retention: 30 days minimum\n\n**Disaster scenarios and responses:**\n\n**1. AWS region failure:**\n- Switch to cross-region replica (manual process currently)\n- Update Route53 to point to backup region\n- Verify Salesforce integration still works\n- Total recovery time: ~2 hours\n\n**2. Data corruption:**\n- Versioning allows immediate rollback\n- Integrity checks should catch before deployment\n- Manual verification process if needed\n- Recovery time: <30 minutes\n\n**3. Ransomware/compromise:**\n- Isolate affected systems immediately\n- Restore from clean backups\n- Full security audit before returning to service\n- Involve ScaleSec and potentially law enforcement\n\n**Testing requirements:**\n- DR drills every 3 years minimum (FedRAMP Li-SaaS requirement)\n- Can be table-top exercises rather than full functional tests\n- Document results in FedRAMP folder\n- Update procedures based on lessons learned"
