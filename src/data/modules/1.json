      "title": "1 | Why FedRAMP Matters to ClearTriage",
      "content": "**What we do:** ClearTriage provides clinical decision support software embedded in the VA's Salesforce environment. Nurses rely on our system to make critical care decisions.\n\n**Why FedRAMP:** Even though we don't handle patient data (we're classified as \"No VA Data\"), we're embedded in a federal system. That means we need FedRAMP authorization to operate. Think of it as our license to help VA nurses do their jobs effectively.\n\n**Your role:** Every one of our six team members is part of our security posture. Whether you're in development, operations, or business functions, your security awareness directly impacts our ability to serve those nurses."

      "title": "2 | Understanding Phishing & Social Engineering",
      "content": "**What is phishing?** Attempts to trick you into revealing passwords, clicking malicious links, or downloading harmful files. These often impersonate trusted sources.\n\n**Common tactics targeting healthcare tech companies:**\n- Fake VA IT support emails (remember: we don't handle VA logins!)\n- \"Urgent\" Salesforce integration alerts\n- Bogus FedRAMP compliance notices\n- Invoice or contract scams targeting small companies\n\n**Red flags to watch for:**\n- Sender addresses that don't match the organization (va-support@gmail.com vs @va.gov)\n- Urgent language demanding immediate action\n- Requests for passwords or MFA codes (Keeper will NEVER ask via email)\n- Links that don't go where they claim (hover to check!)\n- Attachments you weren't expecting\n\n**What to do:**\n1. **Pause** before clicking anything suspicious\n2. **Verify** by contacting the supposed sender through a known channel\n3. **Report** suspicious messages to Pete or Dave immediately\n4. **Never** enter ClearTriage credentials anywhere except our official systems"

      "title": "3 | Password & Access Security",
      "content": "**Our security tools:**\n- **Keeper:** Our password manager for all non-AWS systems. Use it for strong, unique passwords everywhere.\n- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Required wherever available. This is your second line of defense.\n- **YubiKey:** Hardware security keys used for AWS access (Pete & Savvy only).\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Let Keeper generate and store your passwords\n- Never share passwords, even with teammates\n- Enable MFA on every service that offers it\n- Report any system that doesn't support MFA to leadership\n- If you suspect credential compromise: Change passwords immediately and notify Pete/Dave\n\n**Remember:** Since our software is embedded in VA Salesforce with SSO, we never handle nurse logins. If someone claims to need login help for ClearTriage, that's a red flag!"

      "title": "4 | Data Handling & Classification",
      "content": "**What data do we actually handle?**\nClearTriage has been classified as \"No VA Data\" - we don't store, process, or transmit patient information. What we DO handle:\n- **System configurations:** Settings that affect clinical decision support\n- **Application data:** The logic that powers our clinical guidance\n- **FedRAMP documentation:** Compliance artifacts and audit materials\n\n**Where data lives:**\n- **AWS (us-east-1):** All ClearTriage application data and system configurations\n- **Google Drive:** ONLY FedRAMP compliance documentation (SSP, POA&Ms, evidence)\n- **Never on personal devices:** No company data should be downloaded locally\n\n**Why this matters:** While we don't have patient data to protect, compromised system integrity could affect patient care decisions. Treat data integrity with the same seriousness as PHI."

      "content": "**What counts as a security incident?**\n- Suspected account compromise\n- Phishing attempts (successful or not)\n- Unauthorized access attempts\n- System outages or unusual behavior\n- Any security concern, even if you're unsure\n\n**Your incident response process:**\n1. **Don't panic** - but do act quickly\n2. **Contact immediately:**\n   - **Pete Allen** (CTO) - Technical issues\n   - **Dave** (President) - If Pete unavailable or for business impact\n   - **Savvy** (DevOps) - Infrastructure concerns\n   - **ScaleSec** - For complex security issues\n3. **Alert the team:** Post in #general and tag @everyone for awareness\n4. **Document** what you observed (screenshots help!)\n5. **Don't try to fix it yourself** unless instructed\n6. **Continue work** only when given the all-clear\n\n**Remember:** It's better to report a false alarm than miss a real incident. We maintain a no-blame culture for security reporting."

This isn't about suspicion; it's about protecting the company and each other.\n\n**Warning signs in a small company:**\n- Accessing systems outside normal working patterns without explanation\n- Attempting to access Pete/Savvy's production environments\n- Copying large amounts of data or code to personal devices\n- Unusual interest in security procedures or access levels\n- Expressing unusual frustration about access limitations\n\n**How to handle concerns:**\n- Report privately to Pete or Dave\n- All reports are confidential\n- Focus on behaviors, not personalities\n- Let leadership investigate—don't play detective\n\n**Protecting yourself:** Follow security procedures so YOUR normal activities don't look suspicious!"

Every security measure you take helps ensure those nurses can trust the clinical guidance we provide.\n\n**Questions?** Reach out to Pete, Dave, or Savvy anytime. Security concerns are always a priority."
