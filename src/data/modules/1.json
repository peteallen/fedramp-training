      "content": "Welcome to ClearTriage's Security and Privacy Awareness Training! ðŸŽ‰ This training is designed to help our 6-person team understand and meet our FedRAMP Low Impact SaaS (LI-SaaS) requirements for security awareness and training. We know security training can sometimes be as exciting as watching paint dry, so we've added a dash of humor (yes, dad jokes included!) to keep things interesting. But make no mistake â€“ the content here is important for keeping our product and data safe, working toward our FedRAMP authorization (we're in process, not there yet!), and protecting our team and customers. (Don't worry, there's no pop quiz at the end â€“ just pay attention so Pete doesn't have to chase you down... which might take a while since he's often late!)"

      "title": "Scope & Context",
      "content": "Our FedRAMP authorization (once we get it â€“ thanks ScaleSec for guiding us!) will cover the ClearTriage app (running in a FedRAMP-approved AWS environment) and our use of Google Drive for work documentation. We're building this for the VA, so getting this right matters. We do not handle sensitive personal data like PII or PHI, which simplifies privacy concerns. However, security is everyone's job â€“ even a small company can be a target, and our app and internal information (code, configs, etc.) must be protected. In a larger company you might have a big security department; here at ClearTriage, we're all the security team (with Pete Allen, our CTO and resident pain-in-the-ass, wearing the team captain's hat ðŸ§¢ â€“ when he remembers where he put it). So let's dive in and cover what we all need to know, organized by the key FedRAMP Awareness and Training (AT) controls."

    {
      "type": "section",
      "title": "AT-1: Security Awareness & Training Policy Overview",
      "content": "We have a formal Security and Privacy Awareness and Training Policy (because even a 6-person startup needs some paperwork ðŸ“„). This policy â€“ along with detailed procedures â€“ outlines how we do security training and keep everyone aware of best practices. Let's break down the key points about our policy and procedures."
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "title": "Documented & Accessible",
      "content": "The policy is written down (check our Google Drive for the latest \"ClearTriage Security Training Policy\" document â€“ ask Shelly if you can't find it, she's our FedRAMP Coordinator and keeper of all things organized) and disseminated to all personnel (that's all of us!). Since we don't have departments, it's easy â€“ Pete just makes sure each of the six of us gets a copy or link. If you haven't seen it, check your inbox or ask Pete (he might bribe us with donuts to read it â€“ whatever works, especially if they're from that Vermont bakery Shelly keeps raving about)."
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "title": "Roles & Responsibilities",
      "content": "The policy covers who does what. Pete Allen (CTO) is the owner of the training program and the primary contact for any security questions or issues (you can reach him at pete@cleartriage.com for anything from policy clarifications to reporting security concerns â€“ assuming he's not running late to something). Important: If you can't reach Pete or need immediate help, Dave (our President) is your backup contact â€“ and with his CIA-developed psychic bug-finding abilities, he might spot the security issue before you even report it! Pete is responsible for developing and updating the training materials and making sure everyone (yes, all six of us) completes our training on time. Our small size means no one slips through the cracks â€“ if one of us hasn't done the training, we'll all probably hear about it!"
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "title": "Regular Reviews & Updates",
      "content": "We don't write the policy and forget it. The policy itself is reviewed regularly and updated at least every three years (or sooner if something big changes). In practice, Pete will review it annually to see if updates are needed, and formally refresh it at least once every 3 years (FedRAMP requires that minimum). The supporting procedures (the step-by-step of running the training program) get updated more frequently â€“ at least yearly, and any time there's a major change in our systems or a new FedRAMP requirement. For example, if we adopt a new tool, if Savvy implements some new DevOps magic, or if a significant security incident occurs, we'd update our procedures to address that. This ensures our training program stays current with emerging threats and changes in our environment."
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "title": "Dissemination",
      "content": "Whenever the policy or procedures are updated, Pete will disseminate the changes to everyone (likely via an email summary or a quick all-hands meeting â€“ hopefully one he's on time for). Given our team's size, a 15-minute chat can suffice to get everyone on the same page. The goal is that all team members are aware of the rules and expectations around security training and awareness. We keep it straightforward â€“ no corporate jargon overload. If something isn't clear, just ask! We prefer a dumb question over a dumb security mistake."
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "title": "Why This Matters",
      "content": "Having a solid policy (and keeping it updated) might sound bureaucratic, but it's like having a playbook for our security training. It shows management commitment and ensures we're all accountable. Plus, auditors love to see that we have our act together on paper â€“ and we love to keep our future FedRAMP status shiny. So, next time Pete mentions a policy update, remember: reading a few paragraphs now beats dealing with a security fiasco later. ðŸ˜‰"
