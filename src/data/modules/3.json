      "content": "## AT-3: Role-Based Security Training\n\nOne size doesn't always fit all when it comes to training. Role-based training means we tailor extra training content based on your specific job duties. Since we're a six-person outfit, you might wear multiple hats, but we can group our responsibilities to cover what each person needs:\n\n\u2022 **General Awareness for All Roles:** First off, everyone gets the baseline training (that's the AT-2 stuff above \u2013 security awareness, phishing, basic IT hygiene, etc.). That covers the common ground applicable to every role. No one is exempt from knowing things like how to spot a scam or why we don't share passwords. But on top of that\u2026\n\n\u2022 **Technical/Developer Roles:** If you are a developer, DevOps engineer, or otherwise handle our AWS cloud environment, codebase, or infrastructure (looking at you, Savvy and Braden!), you receive specialized training before you get production access, and annually thereafter, focusing on those areas. This includes topics like secure coding practices, code review with a security mindset, secure configuration of AWS services, vulnerability management, and incident response procedures. For example, you'll learn about how to avoid common coding vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, cross-site scripting \u2013 all the \"fun\" stuff) and how to properly manage access keys and secrets in AWS. We might use real-world scenarios (e.g., \"What do you do if you find a security bug in the app?\") to train our tech folks. Don't worry, we keep it practical \u2013 no 100-slide death by PowerPoint. If you're writing code or deploying infrastructure, this training is a must before you touch live systems. Think of it as earning your \"keys to the kingdom\" \u2013 or in Savvy's case, the keys to the samurai dojo. \ud83d\udddd\ufe0f\n\n\u2022 **Operational/Administrative Roles:** If your role is more on the operations, support, or administrative side (Shelly, this definitely includes you as our FedRAMP Coordinator!), you'll get role-based guidance on things like data handling procedures, privacy considerations, and policy compliance. For instance, if someone handles customer support emails or business records, we'll train them on not sharing sensitive info over insecure channels, recognizing social engineering attempts (since support folks can be targets for trickery), and maintaining confidentiality. We don't currently collect PII/PHI, but support might deal with user inquiries \u2013 so it's still important to protect any user communications and not divulge internal info. This role-based content ensures even non-engineers know the rules relevant to their work (e.g., how to use Google Drive securely for documents, how to verify identity of a customer before discussing account details, etc.).\n\n\u2022 **Executive/Leadership Roles:** Well, we basically have Pete (CTO) and Dave (President) \u2013 plus others who might not be hands-on tech but have oversight. For leadership, the training emphasizes understanding compliance requirements (FedRAMP, VA requirements, etc.), risk management, and driving the security culture. Pete, for example, gets training on staying current with FedRAMP updates and how to respond to security audits from ScaleSec. He's also our in-house trainer, so part of his \"role-based\" training is actually training on how to train others and keep the program effective. Dave might use his psychic abilities to sense security risks before they manifest (kidding!), but he also needs to understand the strategic security landscape. In a small company, leaders lead by example: you'll notice Pete always completes his training first (well, maybe not first if he's running late, but he gets it done), and he'll often attend external security webinars to bring back knowledge. So leadership's role training is about being able to champion security and privacy at the organizational level.\n\n\u2022 **Sales & Clinical Roles:** Krista, as our Director of Sales and Clinical Education, gets specialized training on handling customer communications securely, especially given our VA customer base. Her nursing background actually helps here \u2013 she already knows about confidentiality and verification procedures from her L&D days! We'll ensure she knows how to discuss our security features with potential clients without revealing sensitive implementation details.\n\n\u2022 **Multiple Hats / Cross-Training:** Given our size, it's common for one person to fill several roles. In those cases, you'll receive all relevant training modules. We're not going to double the time, but we integrate the content. For example, if you're a developer who also does customer support (maybe while skateboarding, Braden?), you might sit in both the technical training and any ops-focused briefing. The beauty is you get a well-rounded perspective \u2013 and you might even help connect the dots (\"Oh, so that's why the support team needs me to build that feature securely\").\n\n\u2022 **Timing \u2013 Before Privileged Access & Annual Updates:** We ensure that role-based training is completed before you're granted any privileged access or new role responsibilities, and then at least yearly after that. For instance, if you're moving into a DevOps role and will get AWS admin rights, you'll go through a cloud security training module first. Or if we hire a contractor to help with a task, we'll brief them on relevant security procedures before they start. Then, like general training, we'll refresh this role-specific training annually. Each year, we re-evaluate what specialized knowledge needs to be reinforced or updated for each role. Did AWS release a new security feature we should use? We'll mention it. Did our procedures for customer data change? We'll update the ops training. Role-based content is reviewed and updated at least annually (more often if the job function or threats change significantly). We also incorporate any role-specific lessons learned from incidents into the next training. Example: if a developer fell for a targeted code-editing scam (rare, but imagine someone tricked a dev into inserting malicious code), that would definitely become a case study in the next dev training session so it doesn't happen again.\n\n\u2022 **Tracking Completion per Role:** We maintain a simple matrix of who needs what training. With six people, it's not hard \u2013 but it is important. Shelly helps Pete ensure that, say, all developers have done their secure coding module, all support-facing folks did the privacy module, etc. If you ever feel you haven't gotten training you need for your job, speak up! We'll get you covered. We want everyone to feel confident that they know how to do their job securely.\n\nTo keep things engaging, role-based training might involve more interactive elements. For example, developers might do a short secure code review exercise, and support staff might do a role-play of handling a tricky phone call from someone asking for info. We encourage folks to share tips from their experience too. By tailoring training to roles, we ensure relevance \u2013 you get info that helps you in your day-to-day work, not a bunch of abstract theory. And remember, even if something isn't directly in your role, it can be useful knowledge (no harm in a support person understanding a bit about how our code is secured, for instance). So we foster an environment where knowledge sharing is welcome.\n\n*(Light-hearted note:)* If you find yourself receiving all the role-based modules\u2026 you probably are Pete. \ud83d\ude1c Kidding aside, being in a small company means wearing multiple hats, which means learning a bit of everything. Look on the bright side: you'll be a well-rounded security ninja in no time \u2013 maybe even skilled enough to help Braden finally figure out which state he's from!\n\n---\n\nRemember: the goal of all this \u2013 policies, training, insider threat awareness, and role-specific knowledge \u2013 is to build a secure, privacy-conscious culture at ClearTriage. We're working hard toward our FedRAMP authorization, and that comes with responsibilities that each of us shares. By staying informed and engaged with this training content, you're doing your part to keep our app safe, our VA customer happy, and our compliance record spotless.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through this and participate in the training. Security and privacy are truly team efforts, and every one of us is a crucial player. Keep the lessons from this training in mind as you go about your work \u2013 whether you're building houses by hand (Braden), preparing for a new arrival (Savvy), or using psychic debugging powers (Dave) \u2013 and don't hesitate to ask questions or raise concerns anytime.\n\nIn the wise words often repeated in security circles: \"Security is everybody's business.\" By being here and staying aware, you've just helped make our business that much more secure. Now, go forth and may your passwords be strong, your emails phish-free, and your jokes be as safe as our AWS servers! \ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification on any topic covered, reach out to Pete Allen (pete@cleartriage.com) or Dave if Pete's unavailable. They're always happy to help (and will be even happier that you were paying attention). Stay safe out there in cyberspace, team!"
