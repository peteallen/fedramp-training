Since we're a six-person outfit, you might wear multiple hats, but we can group our responsibilities to cover what each person needs.\n\nThink of it as specialized security training that's actually relevant to your day-to-day work ‚Äì not just generic theory that makes you wonder why you're learning about things you'll never use."

That covers the common ground applicable to every role.\n\nNo one is exempt from knowing things like:\n‚Ä¢ How to spot a scam or phishing email\n‚Ä¢ Why we don't share passwords\n‚Ä¢ Basic security hygiene\n‚Ä¢ Company-wide security policies\n\nBut on top of that foundation, you'll get specialized training based on your specific role..."

Don't worry, we keep it practical ‚Äì no 100-slide death by PowerPoint.\n\nIf you're writing code or deploying infrastructure, this training is a must before you touch live systems. Think of it as earning your \"keys to the kingdom\" ‚Äì or in Savvy's case, the keys to the samurai dojo! üóùÔ∏è"

This training ensures even non-engineers know the rules relevant to their work."

Pete always completes his training first (well, maybe not first if he's running late, but he gets it done), and he'll often attend external security webinars to bring back knowledge.\n\nSo leadership's role training is about being able to champion security and privacy at the organizational level."

We'll mention it\n‚Ä¢ Did our procedures change? We'll update the training\n\n## Keeping Current:\nRole-based content is reviewed and updated at least annually (more often if the job function or threats change significantly).

We'll get you covered\n\n## Engagement Approach:\nTo keep things engaging, role-based training might involve more interactive elements:\n‚Ä¢ **Developers** might do a short secure code review exercise\n‚Ä¢ **Support staff** might do a role-play of handling a tricky phone call\n‚Ä¢ **Everyone** is encouraged to share tips from their experience\n\nWe want everyone to feel confident that they know how to do their job securely."

And remember, even if something isn't directly in your role, it can be useful knowledge (no harm in a support person understanding a bit about how our code is secured, for instance).\n\nSo we foster an environment where knowledge sharing is welcome.\n\n## *Light-hearted note:* üòÑ\nIf you find yourself receiving all the role-based modules‚Ä¶ you probably are Pete. Kidding aside, being in a small company means wearing multiple hats, which means learning a bit of everything. Look on the bright side: you'll be a well-rounded security ninja in no time ‚Äì maybe even skilled enough to help Braden finally figure out which state he's from!\n\n## The Big Picture üéØ\n\nRemember: the goal of all this ‚Äì policies, training, insider threat awareness, and role-specific knowledge ‚Äì is to build a secure, privacy-conscious culture at ClearTriage. We're working hard toward our FedRAMP authorization, and that comes with responsibilities that each of us shares.\n\nBy staying informed and engaged with this training content, you're doing your part to keep our app safe, our VA customer happy, and our compliance record spotless.\n\nThank you for taking the time to participate in this training. Security and privacy are truly team efforts, and every one of us is a crucial player. Keep the lessons from this training in mind as you go about your work ‚Äì whether you're building houses by hand (Braden), preparing for a new arrival (Savvy), or using psychic debugging powers (Dave).\n\n## Need Help? üÜò\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification on any topic covered, reach out to **Pete Allen** (pete@cleartriage.com) or **Dave** if Pete's unavailable. They're always happy to help (and will be even happier that you were paying attention).\n\nIn the wise words often repeated in security circles: **\"Security is everybody's business.\"** By being here and staying aware, you've just helped make our business that much more secure. Now, go forth and may your passwords be strong, your emails phish-free, and your jokes be as safe as our AWS servers! üòÅüëç"
