# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a personalized onboarding experience for the ClearTriage FedRAMP Training LMS. When users first access the application, they will be greeted with a welcome screen that collects their role (Development or Non-Development) and name. This information will be used to personalize their training experience by showing role-specific content tags throughout the modules and pre-populating their certificate information.

The onboarding flow replaces the existing "About this Training" section with a more interactive welcome experience that guides users through initial setup while providing the same introductory information. This enhancement supports the compliance training requirements for the 6-person ClearTriage team working with the Department of Veterans Affairs customer.
